# Compass Flash Messages

A simple [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) extension that provides easy and attractive styling for flash messages. And, c'mon, who among us doesn't like easy _and_ attractive?

## Installation

### Now

1. Download the tagged archive
1. Extract the archive's content to `<compass_project_root>/extensions/flash-messages`
1. Navigate to your Compass project root
1. Install the extension

        $ compass install flash-messages

    You should see something like this:

        exists sass
        exists ../img
        create ../img/success.png
        create ../img/info.png
        create ../img/warning.png
        create ../img/error.png
        create ../img/validation.png
        exists ../css

The paths may vary and you'll see additional output, but the gist is that five (5) images were installed in the images directory configured in the `images_dir` value of your `config.rb` file.

### Soon

A gem-based install.

## Usage

### The Stylesheet

    // Import the extension
    @import flash-messages
    
    // Uncomment the mixin below if you're comfortable with the default class names:
    //   .success, .info, .warning, .error, .validation
    // +flash-message-classes
		
    // If you'd rather do your own thing, just include the appropriate
    // message mixin. For example:
    //   body #my-success-message
    //     +success
    //   body #my-error-message
    //     +error

### The Markup

    <!--
      If you're comfortable with the default class names and have included
      the flash-message-classes mixin
     -->
    <div class="(success|info|warning|error|validation)">
      This is an important (success|info|warning|error|validation) message your users need to see
    </div>
    
    <!--
      If you're doing your own thing, using the example SASS shown above
     -->
    <div id="my-success-message">
      This is an important success message your users need to see
    </div>
		
    <div id="my-error-message">
      This is an important error message your users need to see
    </div>

## Credits & Screenshots

I revere good design, much less great design. Unfortunately, I can't design my way out of a wet paper bag. I wish it weren't so, but it's the ugly truth. 

The visual design generated by this extension is <strike>stolen from</strike> in homage to [Janko Jovanovic](http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/page/about-me.aspx) and his work as detailed in his blog article, [CSS Message Boxes for Different Message Types](http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2008/05/22/CSS-Message-Boxes-for-different-message-types.aspx). All I did was translate them to SASS and apply them as a Compass extension. The real work is his and the credit belongs there too.

The icons, as he also mentions in the linked post, are from the [Knob Toolbar Icon](http://itweek.deviantart.com/art/Knob-Buttons-Toolbar-icons-73463960) collection.
